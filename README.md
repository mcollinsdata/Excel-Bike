# Excel-Bike

This is a project I did on a fictional bike store's questionnaire data. It is based on Alex the Analyst's Excel project, but goes a little further with a second
dashboard, powerpoints and report. 

The Excel files are: 
1. Raw data
2. Dashboard1 shows just the first dashboard I created, along the same process as AtA's project. 
3. A completed file with both dashboards. 

The Powerpoints are:
1. A first presentation looking at the data, limitations of it and the first dash. 
2. A more in depth presentation looking at various income-related demographics. 

The Word doc works through the process of Ask, Process, Clean, Analyse, Share, Act.
